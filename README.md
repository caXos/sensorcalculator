This is just a simple project to help my dad find which Arduino Board should he buy depending on how much sensors he needs in his project.

It uses a JSON file as input, with all the Arduino Boards, all sensors, some accessories and their values.
Then, it simply uses JavaScript array methods to filter and sort the data and show the result at the end.

The prices ar in BRL, checked in the last week of May 2024, in the site [MakerHero(https://www.makerhero.com/)]

This project can be tweaked by changing the values of the JSON file and the function that builds the sensors table.
